Ms. Holmes, a Stanford University dropout who founded her company, Theranos, at age 19, captivated investors and the public with her invention: a technology cheaply done at a local drugstore that could detect a range of illnesses, from diabetes to cancer.
With that carefully crafted pitch, Ms. Holmes, whose striking stage presence in a uniform of black turtlenecks drew comparisons to Steve Jobs, became an overnight celebrity, featured on magazine covers and richest-woman lists and in glowing articles.
Her fall — and the near-collapse of Theranos — has been equally dramatic in the last few years. On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ms. Holmes, now 34, with widespread fraud, accusing her of exaggerating — even lying — about her technology while raising $700 million from investors.""",

While most Index measures are not down significantly this quarter, there is a slight softening across measures of business health, cash flow, and increases in staff.
However, according to the results of the survey (conducted between January 28 – February 14), views of the U.S. and local economies are stable this quarter. Around three in ten small businesses (29%) believe that the U.S. economy is in good health and 37% say the same of their local economy. Both of these measures are on par with last quarter and Q1 2024.
The survey’s findings also show that inflation continues to be small business owners’ top concern by far and this concern is at record highs—although concerns about revenue also jumped this month. In fact, consistent for the past three years, inflation (58%) continues to be the biggest challenge facing small businesses.

Culturally, some might view “fake it until you make it” as a simple testament to the faith and hope that business founders have in their company’s innovations and inventions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent enforcement actions serve as a reminder that startup fundraisers cannot use the “fake it until you make it” ethos to whitewash lying to investors. 
Why did the SEC choose to issue this reminder now? The agency did not say. But with the stock markets at record highs, and the promises of billions of dollars to be made in artificial intelligence investments discussed at every turn, excessive frothiness on Wall Street can easily lead to overeager investors in startup land whose investment decisions are governed more by FOMO (the “fear of missing out”) than sound financial analysis.
